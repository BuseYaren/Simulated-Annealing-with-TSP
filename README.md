# Simulated-Annealing-with-TSP
Solution the Optimization Algorithms

**RUNNING THE PROJECT**

    with open("SimulatedAnnealingOPT\gr137.tsp") as b:  
    
  In the data set (tsp file ) in must be changed.
  
  This solution -> Swap Operation, but not enough this data set for optimum value.
  
  To improve, you must use the like 2-opt solutions.
